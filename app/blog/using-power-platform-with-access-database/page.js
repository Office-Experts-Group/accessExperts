          <h2>The Best of Both Worlds for Microsoft Access Users</h2>
          <p>
            If you're like many businesses, your Microsoft Access applications
            are the backbone of daily operations, built over the years, tailored
            to your processes, and working just the way you need them to. But as
            technology evolves and cloud-first tools like Microsoft Power Apps
            become the norm, you're likely feeling the pressure to modernise.
            The problem? Full migration is risky, costly, and often unnecessary.
          </p>
          <p>That's where hybrid Access solutions come in.</p>
          <p>
            Microsoft now offers a powerful way to bridge your existing Access
            database with the modern capabilities of the Power Platform, without
            sacrificing the stability of your existing system. By connecting
            Access to Dataverse, you can unlock mobile access, cloud automation,
            and secure team collaboration, all while preserving your existing
            forms, reports, and VBA logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll explore how hybrid Access - Power Apps setups are helping
            businesses stay relevant, without needing to overhaul their entire
            ecosystem, this guide will show you how to modernise with confidence
            and avoid the pain of starting from scratch.

          <h2>Why Microsoft Access Still Matters in 2025</h2>
          <p>
            Despite being labelled as "legacy" software, Microsoft Access
            remains a cornerstone of business systems across industries from
            accounting firms and manufacturing to healthcare and logistics. Why?
            Because it works. And for many organisations, it works exceptionally
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access offers a low-code environment that empowers business users,
            not just developers, build robust applications for tracking
            inventory, managing clients, and automating near infinite processes.
            It integrates seamlessly with Excel, Outlook, and SQL Server, and
            supports rich form and report building that many modern tools still
            can't match for speed and ease of use.
          </p>

          <div className={styles.BgImageContainer}>
            <h3>Still Widely Used... And Supported</h3>
            <p>
              Microsoft continues to support Access in Microsoft 365, and the
              recent addition of the <strong>Access Dataverse Connector</strong>{" "}
              signals a clear commitment to its future—particularly as a bridge
              to the cloud. In fact, Microsoft states that Access is used by
              "millions of people to run their businesses every day" and is
              "still one of the most popular desktop database solutions".
            </p>

            <h3>Trusted by the People Who Built It...</h3>
            <p>
              For long-term users, Access is more than a tool, it's often an
              essential part of a businesses day-to-day. Staff are trained on
              it... <br></br>Systems are built around it...<br></br> The
              codebase is understood...<br></br>
              Throwing all that away to chase the latest trend can feel like
              burning down a house just to upgrade the plumbing.

          <h2>What Is a Hybrid Access - Power Apps Solution?</h2>
          <p>
            A hybrid Access - Power Apps solution is exactly what it sounds
            like... A smart, integrated approach that allows your existing
            Microsoft Access front-end to connect to a modern cloud-based
            backend. Specifically, Microsoft Dataverse, while extending its
            reach through Power Apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of discarding your Access database and rebuilding your
            application from scratch, you{" "}
            <strong>
              retain your Access forms, reports, queries, and VBA code
            </strong>{" "}
            and simply migrate the data layer to the cloud. This enables a
            seamless connection between Access and Dataverse, opening the door
            to modern features without abandoning what already works.
          </p>

              height={400}
              className={styles.BgImage}
            />
            <h3>How It Works (In Simple Terms)</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Dataverse becomes your new backend</strong>
                <br />
                Tables from Access are exported to Dataverse (or Dataverse for
                Teams), Microsoft's scalable, secure cloud data platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Access remains your front-end</strong>
                <br />
                You continue using Access on the desktop, with linked tables now
                pointing to Dataverse instead of local or shared file-based
                tables.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Power Apps unlocks mobility and automation</strong>
                <br />
                Once your data lives in Dataverse, you can build mobile, and
                browser-based Power Apps for users in the field, embed data into
                Microsoft Teams, and trigger workflows with Power Automate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Security and scalability come standard</strong>
                <br />
                Because Dataverse is built on Azure, you instantly benefit from
                enterprise-grade security, cloud backups, and compliance with
                modern data protection standards.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Why This Matters...</h3>
            <ul style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
              <li>
                <strong>Keep what works</strong> — Your staff continue using
                familiar forms and reports in Access.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Gain cloud flexibility</strong> — Mobile apps,
                dashboards, and automated workflows become possible with minimal
                disruption.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Modernise at your own pace</strong> — There's no 'Major
                Overhaul', in which the whole business comes grinding to a
                hault, simply move gradually and keep your business running
                throughout.

                Key Benefits & Statistics of Going Hybrid with Access and Power
                Apps
              </h2>
              <p>
                A hybrid approach to modernising your Microsoft Access
                application offers a uniquely powerful path forward, one that
                balances stability and innovation without the high cost or
                operational disruption of a complete system rebuild.
              </p>
              <p>
                By migrating your backend data to Microsoft Dataverse while
                continuing to use your Access front-end, your business can
                unlock secure cloud functionality, mobile accessibility,
                real-time collaboration, and powerful workflow automation. All
                this, while still leveraging the systems your team knows and
                trusts.

          <h3>1. Modern Mobility, Without Rebuilding</h3>
          <p>
            By moving your data to Microsoft Dataverse, you can build Power Apps
            that work on mobile phones, tablets, and browsers, while your Access
            desktop app keeps working the way it always has.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Better Collaboration with Microsoft Teams</h3>
          <p>
            Access data can now be surfaced in Teams through connected Power
            Apps. That means frontline or remote staff no longer need to email
            spreadsheets or call back to the office, as they can interact with
            live data in real time, right within the Teams interface.

            <p>
              Migrating your data from on-prem Access tables or shared networks
              into Dataverse means your information is protected by Azure

          <h3>4. Streamlined Workflows with Power Automate</h3>
          <p>
            With your data now cloud-hosted, you can set up automated workflows
            without touching your Access front-end:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Send notifications</li>

          <p>
            Rebuilding an Access app into Power Apps from the ground up can be
            expensive. A hybrid model significantly reduces development hours by
            leveraging your existing Access assets while still enabling modern
            features.

          <h2>Avoiding Migration Pain — What You Keep in a Hybrid Setup</h2>
          <p>
            One of the biggest fears when modernising legacy systems is the loss
            of what already works... Your carefully built forms, customised
            logic, and user-friendly reports. The good news is that a hybrid
            approach with Microsoft Access and Power Apps lets you move forward
            without leaving everything behind.

            If your current system has workflows built around Access reports,
            buttons, and menus, there's no need to retrain staff or redesign
            entire processes. The same Access UI remains in place while your
            data layer shifts to the cloud.
          </p>

          <h3>
            ✅<span style={{ marginLeft: ".3rem" }}></span> Your Reports and
            Print Layouts
          </h3>
          <p>
            Microsoft Access remains one of the most powerful tools when
            generating complex, print-ready reports. By linking your tables to
            Dataverse, these reports continue to function as before, the
            important difference is that you are now receiving them with
            real-time data from the cloud.
          </p>

          <h3>
            ✅<span style={{ marginLeft: ".3rem" }}></span> Your Familiar
            Environment
          </h3>
          <p>
            Users don't need to learn a brand-new system. Access still launches
            from the desktop. The ribbon, navigation pane, and datasheet views
            remain the same. Retooling and training are both expensive and time
            consuming, with the added benefit of now being more error-prone.
          </p>
          <p>
            By keeping these components intact, hybrid solutions offer a
            low-risk path to modernisation. You don't lose what's already
            working... You just expand on what's possible.
          </p>

          <h2>How Hybrid Access - Power Apps Solutions Work</h2>
          <p>
            For decision-makers and technical teams alike, it's important to
            understand how the pieces connect under the hood. A hybrid Access -
            Power Apps solution is not about bolting on extras, it's about
            securely future-proofing your data layer for flexibility while
            keeping your front-end stable and familiar.
          </p>

          <div className={styles.BgImageContainer}>
            <Image
              src={dataverse}
              alt="server to cloud clip art digital design"
              width={600}
              height={400}
              className={styles.BgImage}
            />
            <h3>Step 1: Migrate Your Data to Dataverse</h3>
            <p>
              Using the <strong>Access Dataverse Connector</strong> (introduced
              in Office 365 Access 2013+), you can export selected tables
              directly to <strong>Microsoft Dataverse</strong>—Microsoft's
              enterprise-grade cloud data platform.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Tables become <strong>Dataverse entities</strong>
              </li>
              <li>Relationships, fields, and data types are preserved</li>
              <li>Primary keys and auto-number fields are maintained</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div className={styles.quote}>
            <p>
              <em>
                This step is often handled by Access developers or IT
                consultants using Microsoft's export wizard or Power Platform
                admin tools.
              </em>
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Step 2: Link Access to the Cloud</h3>
          <p>
            Once your tables live in Dataverse, you re-link them in your Access
            front-end using the connector. From this point on, your Access
            forms, queries, and reports are reading and writing{" "}
            <strong>live cloud data</strong>—just like they used to with local
            tables.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 3: Build Power Apps Interfaces (Optional)</h3>
          <p>
            Now that your data lives in Dataverse, you can build mobile-friendly
            Power Apps for specific use cases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Field staff submitting job data via tablets</li>
            <li>Managers reviewing reports on the go</li>
            <li>Clients accessing self-service portals</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These apps read from the same data tables that Access uses, ensuring{" "}
            <strong>data consistency</strong> across platforms.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 4: Automate Workflows with Power Automate</h3>
          <p>
            You can now trigger actions based on changes to data in Dataverse.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>When a new record is added, send a Teams alert</li>
            <li>When a status changes, generate an Outlook task</li>
            <li>When a payment is marked complete, notify finance</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 5: Secure and Govern with Azure AD</h3>
          <p>
            Because Dataverse is built on the Microsoft Power Platform and
            Azure, you gain access to...
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) authentication</li>
            <li>Role-based permissions</li>
            <li>Audit trails</li>
            <li>Conditional access policies</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A hybrid setup doesn't require full re-engineering. It simply
            repositions the data in a secure, scalable cloud system, while
            letting Access handle what it does best.
          </p>

          <h2>Real-World Use Cases & Examples</h2>
          <p>
            Hybrid Access - Power Apps solutions aren't just a theoretical
            workaround... They're being used right now by real businesses to
            modernise operations, empower teams, and extend the life of legacy
            Access applications.

          <p>
            <strong>Challenge:</strong> A regional manufacturer relied on a
            heavily customised Access app to manage production schedules and job
            tickets. However, field staff had no mobile access, and managers
            wanted real-time oversight.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access data was migrated to Dataverse.</li>
            <li>Access remained the main interface for office staff.</li>
            <li>
              A Power App was created for floor staff to update job progress on
              tablets.
            </li>
            <li>Power Automate triggered status updates in Microsoft Teams.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Result:</strong> Job tracking improved, communication delays
            dropped, and the existing Access system remained central, now with
            added mobility.
          </p>

          <h3>Accounting Office Enhances Client Portals</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Challenge:</strong> An accounting firm used Access to manage
            client tax records, but struggled to share data securely with
            clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Client records were moved to Dataverse.</li>
            <li>The firm kept Access for internal reporting.</li>
            <li>
              A secure Power Apps portal was created for clients to view and
              update their records.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Result:</strong> No data duplication, improved compliance,
            and fewer calls from clients needing status updates.
          </p>

          <h3>Healthcare Provider Improves Workflow and Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Challenge:</strong> A medical clinic managed appointments
            and patient records in Access but needed to improve data governance
            and ensure HIPAA compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Access tables moved to Dataverse with Azure-backed security.
            </li>
            <li>Access remained the main app for front-desk staff.</li>
            <li>Power Automate triggered notifications for overdue records.</li>
            <li>Reports were shared securely using Power BI.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Result:</strong> Stronger audit trails, improved workflow
            automation, and Access continued to function as before.
          </p>

          <h2>Move Forward Without Losing Ground</h2>
          <p>
            For many businesses, Microsoft Access is not just a tool... It's an
            entire ecosystem of workflows, logic, and user habits developed over
            years. Ripping it out in favour of a trendy new platform can be
            risky, expensive, and often entirely unnecessary.
          </p>
          <div className={styles.quote} style={{ margin: "1rem auto" }}>
            <p>Modernise where it matters, and preserve what already works.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            By moving your backend to Dataverse, you unlock secure cloud access,
            automation, and mobility, while your Access application remains
            fully functional and familiar to users. It's a path that doesn't
            involve throwing away legacy value, but instead brings it forward
            into the modern Microsoft ecosystem.

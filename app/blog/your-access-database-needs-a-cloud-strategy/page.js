          <h2>2025... and the Future for Access Databases</h2>
          <p>
            If you're relying on a database that's starting to show its age,
            maybe some slow performance, multi-user issues or limited access for
            remote staff... Well you are not alone, and you might be thinking
            that its time to look abroad. But across industries, from law firms
            to manufacturers to government departments, thousands of companies
            still depend on legacy Access solutions to manage day-to-day
            business operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of abandoning their existing system or starting from scratch
            with expensive SaaS platforms or database providers, many
            organisations are successfully evolving their Access databases into

          <h2>Why Access Isn't Dead...</h2>
          <p>
            Despite being over 30 years old,{" "}
            <strong>
              Microsoft Access is still widely used across thousands of
              businesses
            </strong>
            . In fact, research from Landbase.ai shows over{" "}
            <strong>30,000 verified companies</strong> still use Access as of
            2024. Why? Because it solves real business problems — quickly and
            cost-effectively.
          </p>
          <p>Access has long been a go-to tool for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rapid internal app development</li>
            <li>Lightweight data storage</li>
            <li>
              Creating custom forms, queries, and reports without needing a
              software engineering team
            </li>
            <li>
              Handling workflows in finance, HR, inventory, and legal
              departments
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It's especially attractive for{" "}
            <strong>small-to-medium businesses</strong>, non-profits, and even
            departments within large enterprises that need fast, local solutions
            without enterprise IT involvement.
          </p>
          <div className={styles.quote}>
            <p>
              Many government departments and law offices still rely on Access
              to manage sensitive documents and structured workflows that don't
              require full enterprise systems.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            However, Access wasn't built for today's remote-first, cloud-based
            world. It struggles when...
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Databases grow too large (2GB limit)</li>
            <li>Multiple users access it simultaneously over a shared drive</li>
            <li>Teams need access across multiple sites or devices</li>
            <li>Integration with mobile or web apps becomes essential</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So no, Access isn't obsolete... But{" "}
            <strong>it does need help</strong>. A well-planned{" "}
            <strong>cloud augmentation strategy</strong> allows you to retain
            Access where it works best, while solving its biggest limitations
            with cloud infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h2>What a Cloud Strategy for Access Looks Like</h2>
          <p>
            A modern cloud strategy for Microsoft Access doesn't mean scrapping
            your existing system or rebuilding everything from the ground up. In
            fact, one of the greatest strengths of Access is its{" "}
            <strong>ability to adapt and extend</strong>, rather than be
            replaced. The key lies in hybridising your solution — allowing
            Access to continue doing what it does best (custom forms, macros,
            reports, and user-friendly interface design), while shifting the
            heavy lifting, such as data storage, multi-user management,
            scalability, and integration into to more robust, cloud-based
            technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach keeps costs low, retains your team's familiarity with
            Access, and allows for incremental upgrades instead of disruptive
            migrations. By connecting Access to services like Azure SQL
            Database, SharePoint, or Microsoft Dataverse, you can turn a locally
            limited system into a secure, flexible, and future-ready solution
            accessible from anywhere.

              1. Move the Backend to a Cloud Database (e.g., Azure SQL or SQL
              Server)
            </h3>
            <p>
              One of the most powerful upgrades is linking your Access front end
              to a <strong>cloud-hosted backend database</strong>. Two reliable,
              proven methods provided by Microsoft are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Azure SQL Database:</strong> Microsoft's fully managed
                cloud database service
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>SQL Server on Azure:</strong> Ideal for businesses
                already using SQL Server on-premises
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With this simple setup, you can retain your familiar Access
              interface, do-away with the headaches of a full database migration
              and still gain:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Greater <strong>scalability</strong> (no more 2GB size limit)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improved stability</strong> with concurrent users
              </li>
              <li>
                Access to <strong>cloud backups and failover protection</strong>
              </li>
              <li>Real-time connectivity from multiple geographic locations</li>

          </div>

          <h3>
            2. Integrate with SharePoint or OneDrive for Remote File Access
          </h3>
          <p>
            For businesses with remote teams, satellite offices, or hybrid work
            environments, Access databases often run into limitations when
            stored locally or on shared drives. That's where integrating with
            SharePoint or OneDrive for Business becomes a game-changer.
          </p>
          <p>
            By storing your Access front-end files (.accdb or .accde) in
            SharePoint or OneDrive, users can securely access and open the
            database from anywhere with an internet connection. This setup not
            only supports mobility, but also ensures that all team members are
            working from the most current version of the file, reducing version
            conflicts and outdated data errors.
          </p>
          <p>
            SharePoint and OneDrive also offer built-in version control,
            automatic backups, and integration with Microsoft 365 security
            protocols like multifactor authentication and conditional access.
            This means your files are accessible, safe, auditable, and compliant
            with modern IT governance standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach is especially helpful for teams that collaborate on
            Access templates or reports, allowing users to co-manage and update
            Access front ends while keeping the backend linked to a central SQL
            Server or Azure database. It's a simple way to extend Access into
            the cloud without overhauling your infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Introduce Power Platform for Automation and Mobility</h3>
          <p>Once your data lives in a central SQL database, you can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use Power Apps to create mobile- and browser-friendly interfaces
            </li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This means your Access database doesn't just live in a desktop app —
            it can now{" "}
            <strong>
              interact with the tools your team already uses every day

            <p>
              By moving your backend to the cloud and integrating with Microsoft
              365, you can:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Use <strong>Azure Active Directory</strong> for secure user

              </li>
              <li>
                Control access via{" "}
                <strong>Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD B2B/B2C)</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                Comply with modern data protection standards like ISO 27001 or
                GDPR
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is a huge benefit for regulated industries like legal,

          <h2>Benefits of a Hybrid Access + Cloud System</h2>
          <p>
            Combining Microsoft Access with cloud technologies delivers the best
            of both worlds... The flexibility and customisation that users are
            familiar with, paired with the scalability, performance, and
            security of modern cloud infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            By keeping Access at the front end, you maintain a familiar
            interface for users who are already trained and comfortable with its
            forms, reports, and navigation. This minimises disruption and
            training overhead while ensuring business continuity. In essence,
            you future-proof your Access solution while keeping it lean and
            agile.

            dozens (or even hundreds) of simultaneous users — far surpassing the
            technical limitations of a traditional Access backend. By shifting
            your data storage to the cloud, you eliminate concerns around
            Access's 2GB size limit, frequent file corruption due to multiple
            concurrent users, and the fragility of relying on shared network
            drives.

            What makes this transition especially powerful is retaining the
            backing of the Microsoft ecosystem. For almost 50 years now,
            Microsoft has been a trusted, enterprise-grade platform used by
            governments, Fortune 500 companies, and regulated industries around
            the world.

            <h3>2. Remote Access for Distributed Teams</h3>
            <p>
              With a hybrid model, your Access front-end can connect to a
              central data source in the cloud — enabling{" "}
              <strong>remote staff, satellite offices, or field workers</strong>{" "}
              to access and update data from anywhere with internet access.
            </p>
            <p>This is especially useful in:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Post-COVID hybrid workplaces</li>
              <li>Legal practices with multiple offices</li>
              <li>Teams spread across regional or international locations</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>3. Data Security & Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            Storing your data in the cloud (e.g., Azure or Microsoft 365) means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Built-in <strong>data encryption and backup</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Granular <strong>permission controls</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Disaster recovery</strong> options baked in
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This allows your organisation to meet compliance needs (e.g. ISO,
            HIPAA, GDPR) without heavy investment in on-premises infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Future-Ready Integration</h3>
          <p>
            Once in the cloud, your data becomes part of the{" "}
            <strong>Microsoft Power Platform ecosystem</strong>, unlocking:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Power BI</strong> for dashboards and analytics
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Power Apps</strong> for mobile access and lightweight
              custom interfaces
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Power Automate</strong> for workflow triggers, approvals,
              and alerts
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These tools connect natively with Access-linked cloud databases,
            enabling <strong>automation, mobility, and modernisation</strong> —
            all without needing to retrain staff or throw away years of
            investment.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Cost Efficiency</h3>
          <p>
            Cloud-based infrastructure operates on{" "}
            <strong>pay-as-you-go models</strong>, which means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>No hardware maintenance</li>
            <li>No expensive upfront licensing</li>
            <li>Resources scale with usage</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Most importantly, you avoid costly and risky full-system rebuilds —
            and extend the life and ROI of your existing Access solution.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion: Extend, Don't Abandon Your Access System</h2>
          <p>
            Microsoft Access isn't obsolete... It just needs to evolve. For
            thousands of businesses, Access remains a powerful, cost-effective
            tool for managing data, creating reports, and building
            business-specific workflows. But in today's remote, integrated, and
            cloud-first world, it needs a modern strategy to stay competitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than throwing away years of investment in a working Access
            solution or wasting countless hours on a full migration, a
            <strong> hybrid Access + cloud approach</strong> lets you:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep your custom forms and reports</li>
            <li>Solve performance and sharing limitations</li>
            <li>Meet growing data and compliance requirements</li>
            <li>
              Open the door to mobile apps, automation, and real-time insights
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In other words,{" "}
            <strong>
              you modernise what matters — without starting from scratch
            </strong>
            .
